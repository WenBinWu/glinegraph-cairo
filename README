GlgLineGraph (a.k.a cairo version of glinegraph )  July 2007

    A Gtk2/GLib2/cario GUI application which demonstrates the use of GTK+ for
 producing xy line graphs.  This widget once created allows you to add one or more
 data series, then add values to those series for ploting.  The X point is assumed based
 on arrival order.  However, the Y value or position is based one the current scale and
 the y value itself.  If the charts x scale maximum is 40, or 40 points, the 41+ value is
 appended to the 40th position after all points are shifted left and out through pos 0.
 
 Packaged as a gtk widget for ease of use.	

 A lgcairo.c example program is included to demonstrate the possible use of the codeset.

There is also gtk-style API documentation in ./src/docs/reference/html/index.html

FEATURES: 
    * GlgLineGraph API Reference Manual in ./src/docs/reference/html/index.html
    * Unlimited data series support.
    * Accurate scaling across a wide range of X & Y scales.
      - Using values ranges above or below 1.
    * Rolling data points, if number of x points exceed x-scale. (left shift)
    * Ability to change chart background color, window backgrounds colors, etc.
    * Popup Tooltip, via mouse-button-1 click to enable/toggle.
      - Tooltip overlays top graph title, when present.
    * Data points are time stamped with current time when added.
	* Some key debug messages to console with button-3 enable, then button-2 click/toggle.
	* Auto Size to current window size; i.e. no-scrolling.
	* point-selected signal tied to tooltip, to display y value under mouse.
